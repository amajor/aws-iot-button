* Initialize your button using the [AWS IoT Button Dev mobile app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/aws-iot-button-dev/id1178216626?mt=8)
  * Choose a **nodejs** option for your Lambda function

## Getting Started

Once you've initialized your button using your phone, you can log into your AWS account. In the *AWS Services* search bar, type *Lambda* and click on the **Lambda** selection that appears.

You should see the Lambda function that you created by initializing your button using the app on your phone.

Click on the function name to enter into the function editor.

From there, you can copy and paste the code you want into your function.

You may need to make use of environment variables for any sensitive information like phone numbers or web hooks. The names being used for any environment variables in the code snippets should be called out in code comments where it's relevant.
